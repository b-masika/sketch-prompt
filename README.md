🚀 The Future of Sketch Prompt: Roadmap
Sketch Prompt is designed to evolve into a full-scale ecosystem for artistic growth. Beyond the current MVP, the following features are in development:

1. Social & Community (The "Studio Floor")
Sketch Uploads: A dedicated community feed where users post their daily studies.

Redline Feedback: An "Open to Redlines" toggle for users seeking anatomical or perspective corrections from mentors.

Engagement: Full support for comments, likes, and advice-sharing threads.

2. Gamification & Consistency
30-Day Streak System: A monthly calendar view to track completed daily challenges and maintain streaks.

Achievement Badges: Milestone rewards like "Early Bird" (pre-8 AM completions) or "Perspective Pro" (5+ Architecture prompts).

Mod Days: Special challenge modes like "Blind Contour" or "2-Minute Speed Studies" to keep the 34-prompt set fresh.

3. Artist Analytics Dashboard
Growth Tracking: Radar charts showing practice distribution (e.g., 60% Urban, 40% Nature).

Progress Snapshots: Side-by-side "1-minute gesture" vs. "20-minute study" comparisons.

Time Analytics: Data visualization of time spent on each category to identify areas for improvement.

4. Advanced Reference Tools
Reference Scrubbing: Interactive toggles for Grayscale and Threshold filters to help beginners identify values without color distraction.

User Accounts: Secure authentication to save progress, favorites, and personal sketch galleries.
